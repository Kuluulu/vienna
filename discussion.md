### Key patterns and Insights

First, one noticeable pattern is that although GDP per capita and life expectancy have been tracked completely between 1960 and 2024, CO2 emissions per capita is only available between 1990 and 2020.

#### Life expectancy

While the Democratic Republic of Congo has seen a constant increase in life expectancy at birth, increasing from 41 to 62 years (which averages to one third of a year per calendar year), Burundi's life expectancy development was less monotonic. Associated to the 1972 Ikiza mass killings (often characterised as a genocide) and the 1993 ethnic violence following the conflicts between Tutsi and Hutu, there are big dents in the otherwise increasing life expectancy curve. In the 1970s, the life expectancy decreased from around 43 years to 26 years and in the 1990s the life expectancy decreased from about 45 years to 37 years.

In the late 2000s, Burundi's life expectancy has overtaken the Dem. Rep. of Congo's. In recent years, both countries have reached the 60-year mark and are continuing to trend upwards.

#### CO2 emissions

The CO2 emissions of either country have never added up to more than 0.1 tons per capita per year in any year of the available time period.

For comparison, Austria's CO2 emissions per capita were around 6.5 tons per capita in 2023.
 

### Follow-up Questions

Further work would need to go into investigating the methods that were used to generate the World Bank data and to research whether there is information on the associated uncertainties of the data.
